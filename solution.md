## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses

The majority of my criticisms center around the question of whether the Material Design approach changes when applied to web development. The website is, and I doubt many would argue, appealing if not very attractive. With fairness in mind, the web for personal computers is a different medium, and I would expect some kind of design conflict. 


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. While Google’s implementation of the Material Design philosophy on the Material Design website is certainly material-y in its visual appeal, I’m frustrated that the accent color has thus far been white on every page. It should be acknowledged however that as a website with which most users will interact on a personal computer, its navigation interactivity will be different. For example, the Material Design website has no need for a FAB, which is the element that we’ve most typically seen the accent color displayed. That justification aside for a moment, in terms of interacting with a more mobile-like display, even it doesn’t make perfect sense for a website, would be more immersive learning experience. 


2. I would have liked to see more Cardview-like elements on the Material Design website. Rather, there is the conventional paragraph title followed by paragraph content and together followed by another pair of the same form and so on structure. I’m sure Google considered it and decided no for good reason, but it could have been interesting to see Cardviews containing paragraph content in a recycler view on the Material Design website. 


3. The buttons on the website do become darker for about it seems one second, however this responsiveness is different from what users should expect on a mobile device. It’s clear that the button has been clicked, but I wonder whether if navigation feels less precarious on a computer. 


4. I also appreciate the range of primary colors used across the website in the toolbar, even if that does not apply to the accent color. 

5. I regret that Google did not approach the design of the Material Design website with more of a sense of that mobile developers would not only read the learning materials on the site, but would experience that physcial layout more intimately as they're thinking about how the site does or does not fulfull the design specifications for which its asking.


##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1. The action bar is presented similarly to how one should appear on a mobile device, and does make proper use of a secondary color to display “related information” and included buttons.


2. When clicked, the more-options button on the far left of the toolbar does present a scrollable index of the site. True to Material Design, the fashion in which the index menu “enters” does move across the screen with seeming physicality of a tangible project, or what we might call “authentic motion”. 


3. The layout of different content is spaced generously as if constrained by the physical limitations of a handheld. Additionally, far more information could have been placed on each page. This follows the specs of Material Design because of the emphasis on readability, and not overwhelming the user with view on top of view on top of view.
