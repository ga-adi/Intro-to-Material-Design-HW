## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1. I like that Google has the design for almost everything already laid out there for you.  You don't really have to think.

2. I like that Google created their design to have layers.  The concept of elevation is interesting to me and using shadows to make things stand out is great.

3. I like that they give you suggested color palettes.

4. I like that they give you the specifications for the margins/padding between elements.

5. I don't like that this manual is so long.

##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1. They definitely follow the color scheme on each page.

2. They keep things simple by having the main toolbar up top with the search function and a menu bar.

3. Everything appears to follow the same spacing format between content.
