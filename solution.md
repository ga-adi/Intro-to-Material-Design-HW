## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.



1. The fact that the designs specs are so specific, and seem to cover almost every scenario is a nice tool in itself to help you when creating an app from scratch.
2. The focus on motion for a ui object not only indicates that a ui object has been activated, it also provides the feeling of interaction with something real.
3. Simulating 3D objects (light,shadow, y axis elevation,mass, weight) is a great way to allow the user to feel like he/she is interacting with more than just a 2D surface.
4. The 3D object focus is also a double edge sword. You get nice looking apps, but there are so many options, and properties that you have to know to get it to look right.
5.  There doesn’t  seem to be a tool that you can easily set all the different properties.
6. Themes are available, but seem limited.
7. The concept of “stories” seems subjective (in the Style-Imagery section) and maybe a little difficult to represent as specs.

3. Writing- The writing is clear, accurate  and concise. You never see a paragraph that is more than three sentences long.
