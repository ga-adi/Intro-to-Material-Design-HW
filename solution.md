## Intro to Material Design Homework - Responses


##### Write at least 5 things that you like or dislike about the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) website design.

1.  I was really into cinematic lighting for a while, so I have an appreciation for the consideration of realistic light sources and shadow casts when shadows become a part of the design.

2.  The way that material design is modeled from paper gives it a great look, but it could be kitschy for some people's tastes.

3.  I agree on using authentic pictures to illustrate an idea.  Death to stock photos!

4.  I feel sort of indifferent towards roboto typeface.  It's alright, but I could see i getting dated.

5.  More touch gestures could be useful, maybe even customizable ones, like drawing the letter F to open facebook.
