##### Write at least 3 reasons why the [Google Design Specifications](https://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) design follows Material Design guidelines. Be as specific as possible.

1.The point is to create an environment which isn’t 2D but rather feels as an immersive depth filled environment.  To lead intuition through colors and shading towards interaction and meaning.  How?

2.  Pick a major color and use variations of lighter and darker shades throughout the app. Be consistent.  Text should be white or Black depending on the background.  Spacing should be present and is important.  Size is important.  And…

3.  An Accent color should contrast with the major color (Pink to Blue, Green to Purple, etc.) This should be used to imply hyperlinks in text, buttons, or other standout interactive features.  Accent implies interaction.  It also should be tweaked regarding shade and intensity of the color.
